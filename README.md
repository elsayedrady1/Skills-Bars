![I'm example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/956682149979889705/965086124060069988/unknown.png)


#### Step 1 : 
<br>

###### First paste html code in empty spce in html file and if you don't have one i suggest this file name : ```index.html```

<br>
<hr>

#### Step 2 :

Make new file if you don't have suggested name : ```Style.css``` , 
then paste css code or download it directly
<br>

<hr>

###### If you want to make more skills make :

```<div class="bar">
            <div class="info">
                <span>Replace this by your skill</span>
            </div>
            <div class="progress-line Skills">
                <span></span>
            </div>
```
and when you replace it probably you must add your new skills name in css also you must replace your percentage 
 <hr>

``` 
progress-line.skills span::after {
  content: "92%";
}
```
